1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.
  * My proudest professional achievement was working on the document hosting project for NRECA. We got to use a bunch of open source technologies and we saved the company a ton of money by obsoleting our third party vendor. I learned a lot about retirement and the various tradeoffs between implementing things natively versus using a higher level framework or library (e.g. native-sql versus object relational mappers).
2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc) 
  * https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
  * I'd recommend the aforementioned react-js tutorial for anybody getting started with react. It covers lesser known topics like how to organize your components, how to handle side affects, and where to store state in your components. There are also really neat diffs that show how the code progresses and changes as you refactor and or advance from one lesson to the next. Most importantly the tutorial also sheds light on the importance of immutability in react.js and how to implement it.
3. How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does? 
  * Availity provides claims management and payment support for providers.
